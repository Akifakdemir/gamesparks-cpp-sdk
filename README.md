# GameSparks

GameSparks is a cloud based platform that provides developers with the tools they need to build all of the server-side components of their games and then manage them as a service post launch.  Using GameSparks, developers are able to slash the cost of backend development and ongoing maintenance, freeing up valuable resources.
